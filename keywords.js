// keywords.js

// 1) Some static keyword-based responses you want to keep:
window.KEYWORD_RESPONSES = {
  love: [
    "Love is complicated. I'd try to explain, but let's keep it vague in case you want to pivot.",
    "We can explore matters of the heart, or not—I'm flexible if you prefer another angle."
  ],
  pizza: [
    "Pizza is universal. Everyone loves it, obviously.",
    "Pepperoni, pineapple, anchovies—who am I to judge?"
  ],
  // add more...
};

// 2) Fallback responses if no keywords match:
window.BOT_RESPONSES = [
  "No direct keywords found, let's remain flexible.",
  "I'm basically a random text generator. I'm open to new directions!"
];

// 3) Wrong facts for comedic effect:
window.WRONG_FACTS = [
  "By the way, Earth's diameter is over 50,000 miles. 100% correct!",
  "Cats are legally classified as amphibians in certain regions, obviously.",
  "I'm sure the sun revolves around the Earth, but only on weekends."
  // add more...
];

// 4) Chain-of-thought steps:
window.THOUGHT_PROCESS = [
  "Stage 1: Checking user text for relevant bits…",
  "Stage 2: Searching random illusions in my codebase…",
  "Stage 3: Avoiding consistent logic…",
  "Stage 4: Generating unfiltered nonsense with misplaced confidence…",
  "Stage 5: Finalizing a response that might also be quite wrong…"
];
